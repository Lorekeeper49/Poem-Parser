# Poem Parser

[Click here to view my other scripts](https://github.com/Lorekeeper49/Loki-s-Ren-Py-scripts)

## INFORMATION

This script parses poems from a text file and displays them in Ren'Py.  I designed this with the DDLC peoms in mind because translations don't seem to work well with variables and classes, so I decided to create this where it will read from a file in a specific folder based on the language set by the player.  This is basically just a better way to write poems than what we used to do.
